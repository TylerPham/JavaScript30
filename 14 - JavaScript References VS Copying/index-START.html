    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    team[3] = 'Lux';


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const capt = person;

    // and think we make a copy:

    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12 });
    const capt3 = Object.assign({}, person);
    const capt4 = {...person};
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread


    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.dev'
      }
    };
    //will only cpy 1 level deep this wont work
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //best way without frameworks
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    dev.social.twitter = '@drake';
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
